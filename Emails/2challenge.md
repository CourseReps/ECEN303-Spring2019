Students:

This email introduces Challenge 2, which is due on Tuesday, March 5, 2019. The description of Challenge 2 is on GitHub.

       ECEN303-Spring2019 -> Challenges -> 2Challenge -> 2challenge.ipynb

This challenge includes two \activities. To complete the activities, perform the following tasks.

       1. Make sure that you have your own directory under “Students”
       2. In your own directory, you will find a subdirectory named “2Challenge”
       3. If needed, copy the aforementioned “2challenge.ipynb” to the newly created folder.
               ECEN303-Spring2019 -> Students -> <Your NetID> -> 2Challenge -> 2challenge.ipynb
       4. Perform the tasks as described in the Jupyter notebook.
       5. Add and commit the modified “2challenge.ipynb”, “2challenge-1.csv”, and “2challenge-2.csv” to Git
       6. Pull recent changes, and push your code on GitHub

Do NOT edit the source file included under “Challenges/2Challenge/“; that file belongs to me. Please, do NOT break our GitHub and do not commit extraneous files. This is an individual challenge, but exchanging with other students is acceptable. (Do not copy code from your peers.) Learn and explore. Be curious and inquisitive.

Best regards,

Jean-Francois Chamberland

Due Date: Mar 5, 2019
